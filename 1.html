  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specificication">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
  <p>A key objective for the WHATWG was backwards compatibility to ensure good rendering of existing websites.</p><p style="margin-top:50px;">
  With these objectives in mind, the dependence of HTML on SGML was eliminated for HTML 5 and the specification includes details on how browsers are to render pages and howx parsers are to handle shortcuts such as missing end tags. The XML-based serialization requires the use of a different Internet media type and has different rules for declarations at the beginning of the document.</p>

  <br><br><br>Many detailed changes were introduced to provide more effective support for interactivity, for example, to support editing within web pages, with features such as drag-and-drop and spellchecking.
  Many new HTML APIs available to developers, particularly for creating interactive applications, were introduced. Several existing APIs were extended, changed or obsoleted.
